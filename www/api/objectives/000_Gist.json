But mailing one's code is a hassle when you have to deal with \nlots of different files and endless lines of code. Another way is to place \nthese on Github, a website made for and by programmers to store and share \ncode.\n\nGithub offers two ways to do that. The first is making a repository. More on\nthis will follow later. The second way is Gist, particulary handy for code \nsnippets and a lot easier -though with some limitations.\n"},"tasks":[{"title":"Create your first Gist","instructions":["Go to [http://gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com).","Write some simple HTML or CSS into the box on your screen."]},{"title":"Experiment with Syntax Highlighting","instructions":["Give the file the name 000_Gist_Assignment.html or 000_Gist_Assignment.css.","Notices that the your html/css now has certain words in color."]},{"title":"Gist it with Github","instructions":["Log in with Github","Put the HTML or CSS you wrote into the box on the screen"]},{"title":"Share your Gist","instructions":["Click \"Create public Gist\" in the bottom right corner.","Put the link to your gist in our [Slack](fishbowl.slack.com) Channel."]}]}
