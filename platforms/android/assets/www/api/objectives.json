The information that is needed to render a page is stored on a server. In order to retrieve that data the browser needs to request it from the server. These request are using a protocol called http which is the foundation of any web application.\nWhenever you want to show a change on the page, we need to send an http request to refresh the entire page, even if we just want to change one little piece of it. If we would have a widget that needs to update regularly this is obviously not the most efficient way of doing this, because it constantly has to wait for everything.\nThis is where Ajax comes in. Ajax is a method to communicate with a server in the background, without interfering with the current state of the page. This technique is what makes modern web apps possible.\n","summary":"This objective helps you understand how communicating between the browser and the server works.\n"},"tasks":[{"title":"Learn the Basics","description":"Ajax is a group of interrelated web development techniques used on the client-side to communicate with the server that runs in the background.
